## Pre-installation

Use Node.js LTS, you can use NVM to manage Node versions on your local

### Dependencies

Make sure you have `node`, `npm` and `angular/cli` installed in your machine.

#### Install node and npm

Must have `node` and `npm` installed, other wise its better to install them using [nvm](#Install-NPM-via-NVM).

#### Install Angular/cli

To install `angular/cli` run

```shell
  npm install -g @angular/cli@{{version}}
```

For Aymme we are using version `~12.0.0`, run

```shell
  npm install -g @angular/cli@~12.0.0
```

## Installation

### Build the environment

```shell
  npm install
  ng build
```

## Install NPM via NVM

### Installing nvm

1- Clone repository

```shell
  wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

2- Add this to your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`)

```text
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

3- Restart your machine or run

```shell
  source {{profile}}
```

profile: (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`)

### Installing npm

1- To get list of available versions run

```shell
  nvm ls-remote
```

2- Select version from the list and install it run, (Better to install latest LTS version)

```shell
  nvm install {{selected-version}}
```

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@aymme/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to [Localhost](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
